Notes on Documentation
2015-08-21 to 2015-08-21

We have currently commented out the building of this Doxygen-based
documentation from the top-level Makefile.am module.  We hardly
ever need to rebuild the PDF files, whereas we always need to rebuild the
code for debugging.  It gets tiresome to wait for the PDF files to get
built, and tiresome to remember to leave the new PDFs out of the
"git add" command.

For now, we will remember to rebuild the PDF files manually whenever we make
a notable update to the code or to the *.dox files.
