midi2text (it is derived from those projects), and adds support for direct
MIDI-to-MIDI conversions driven by an INI file, using a C++ add-on.

Standard Install:

    If you have a source tarball, such as midicvt-master-0.4.1-stable.tar.xz,
    untar this file in a temporary place and run

    $ ./configure

Advanced Install:

    If you want to start from scratch, use the bootstrap script:

        $ ./bootstrap

    The do the "Standard Install" described above.

    If you want to make a source tarball, bootstrap the project, then
    run a command like this:

        $ ./pack --release 0.4.1 stable

# vim: sw=4 ts=4 wm=4 et ft=sh
