          INTRODUCTION 

               "Cloudburst Flight"   is   my   first   tune  done  using
          Cakewalk.   I  have  three songs in progress that were started
          using  Edit  Track  II on the Atari ST.  If I ever finish them
          (oh,  I  have  such learning to do!), they will have been done
          on   two   different  sequencers  on  two  different  computer
          platforms.   Before  I  get into the music, let me quickly say
          that  I  did  not  switch  to  a new system because either the
          Atari  ST or Edit Track were bad.  My main motivation was that
          my  day-jobs have put me heavily into PC programming, and it's
          much  easier  if one has a similar machine at home.  Also, PCs
          have  finally  gotten  so  good  and  so cheap that the Atari,
          Amiga,  and  MacIntosh have no overwhelming advantages for the
          *generic*  user.   And they're so good and cheap that I didn't
          feel  cheated in buying one.  Taiwanese PC clones represent an
          amazing bargain! 


          DISCUSSION 

               Although this  tune  is  in  SMF  format, like the others
          I've  done,  it  is  layed  out quite differently.  I got real
          used  to  Cakewalk's  256  tracks,  and took full advantage of
          this  elbow  room.   Hence,  instead of around 20 tracks, this
          sequence  has  53.  If your sequencer cannot handle it, let me

          know,  and  I'll  mix  some  tracks  together.  Lack-o'-tracks
          shouldn't be a problem nowadays.  

               The timebase   used   is   192   pulses-per-quarter-note.
          Versions  of  Cakewalk prior to 4.0 could handle only 120 ppq,
          I  believe,  so  users  of the older software might experience
          some  minor  inaccuracies,  but  certainly  no  more  than  my
          playing introduces.  Let me know if it is a problem.  

               Cakewalk has  an  extra  column  of  text  notes for each
          track.   That  is  the  only extra you'd get if I gave you the
          Cakewalk  version,  and  it is copied below.  I use it to tell
          me  which  voices  to  choose.   It should be a guide to those
          with   non-Yamaha   voicings.    Unlike   previous  sequences,
          however,  I  left  all  the  patch  changes  in their original
          tracks.   Sequencers  nowadays should make it easier to locate
          and  change  them.   If  not, let me know, and I'll consider a
          version  with  a  separate PSS-790 track.  If you need to know
          the  PSS-790  instruments,  find a copy of my PSS.TXT (PSS.LZH
          on GEnie, if I remember right).  Or call me.  

               Cakewalk lets  you  strip  the program changes all out in
          one  fell  swoop,  and  lay them into one track.  However, the
          CAL  language  isn't complex enough to make it easy to write a
          program  to  convert  from  PSS-790  to other instruments very
          easily.  Ya gotta do it by hand.  

               The song has the usual sacrifices I have to make: 

              1.  Extra voices to achieve an effect.  

              2.  Voices left out because I didn't hear them.  

              3.  Raggy lead instrument solos (I really need a 
                  guitar controller and some lessons).  

              4.  Amateurish sound mixing.  

              5.  Precious few special effects.  


          IRRELEVANT STORY 

               Went to  L.A.  traffic  school  couple a weeks or so ago.
          What  a stupefying experience! Some fun, but I think the whole
          "class"   left  feeling  pretty  numb.   Being  reminded  that
          driving  a  car  incurs  a certain risk of flaming death is no
          fun.

               Cakewalk starts the number from octave 1, rather than from -1.
          Hence, subtract two octaves from the designations given by
          Cakewalk.

          KEEPING TRACK OF TRACKS 

               My musical  ignorance  shows through in the names I chose
          for  the tracks.  Yet, the two sets of track names should give
          you  enough  data  to  pick  reasonably  good patches for your
          synth.  

               The drum  tracks aren't really suited to the DD-11.  I've
          been  having  trouble  with  my  pocket filter, and so haven't
          transposed  some  of  the  notes so that they play properly on
          the  DD-11.   The  DD-11  and  PSS-790 have similar, but by no
          means identical, drum layouts.  

               For the  pitch  bend,  set  all patches to respond to the
          range  of  -8169 to +8064 with pitch bend of -1 to +1 octaves.
          The  PSS-790, even with only 7 significant digits to the pitch
          bend,   having   to  cover  a  whole  octave,  still  provides
          adequately smooth bending.  

               I included  a  track  that's supposed to set up my Pocket
          Filter  so  that  the dang Yamaha DD-11 drum set responds only
          to  channel  16.   I've  been  having  some  problems with it,
          though,  and  didn't  bother  to  make the drums totally match
          those  of  the  DD-11.   Instead,  they  match all the PSS-790
          drums.  

               Track 2  is  simply  a  little  joke;  it  is part of the
          corporate  anthem  of  the corporation that owns a popular New
          Age  (Muzak) FM station in Los Angeles.  The real music starts
          in measure 3.  

               If you don't like any tracks, turn 'em off.

               Actually, the  whole  Bart  logo  idea  came  from  Scott
          Abderhalden.  Who knows where he got it?
