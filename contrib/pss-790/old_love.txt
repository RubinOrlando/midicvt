INTRODUCTION

	This is the first song I've done with a machine sensitive
to volume and velocity.  Since the PSS-790 doesn't transmit velocity,
I had to edit velocity graphically (I can't play keyboards very
well, anyway.)  I took great pains to make the velocity and
pitch bend as realistic as possible.  Of course, it's only
my best shot as of today.
	
	The original format was Edit Track II (Atari ST) --
download MIDIMOVR.ARC from the MIDI section of GEnie, to play this
file.  MIDIMOVR is "freeware" provided by Hybrid Arts.  It plays SMF 0
1, EZ-Track+, and Midi-Track (Edit Track) files.  The mouse buttons
are significant!


LYRICS AND CHORDS

	The essence of this song is simplicity, with fairly
complex guitar improvisations.  I followed the score very faithfully,
but there are a couple of places where I put my own improvisations
in.  Can you detect them?  (Can you say "sententious"?  I knew
you could.)

	The accompaniment tracks (drum, bass, etc.) are fairly
simple and repetitious.  I did not bother to make every reiteration
unique.  Hope it's not too boring.

	Rhythm figure 1 consists of the sequence of Am, Dm7,
Gsus4, and G.  Rhythm figure 2 consists of F, Ftype2, F, E, G#,
D, E, G#, E, Am, Am+7, Am7, Am6, Ftype3, A, C, A, C, D, Etype2,


1.  (Fig. 1) I can feel your body/ When I'm lying in my bed.
    Too much confusion/ Goin' 'round through my head.

    (Fig. 2) It makes me so angry/ To know that the flame still burns.
    Why can't I get over?/ When will I ever learn?

    (Chorus; Fig. 1) Old love/ Leave me alone.
    Old love/ Go on home.

2.  I can see your face/ But I know it's not real.
    It's just an illusion/ Caused by how I used to feel.

    And it makes me so angry/ To know that the flame will always burn.
    I'll never get over/ I know that I'll never learn.

    Old love/ Leave me alone.
    Old love/ Go on home.
    Take me home, baby (whispered).

    (Robert Cray guitar solo)
    (Eric Clapton guitar solo)

    Old love/ Leave me alone.
    Old love/ Go on home.

KEEPING TRACK OF TRACKS

	The vocal and guitar tracks came from a score that included
notation for all sorts of quitar tricks.  On the guitar solos,
I doubled up and delayed the notes.  Might have overdone it.

	The Edit Track version of this file employs chains to
control playback.  For the SMF version, I flattened each chain.
This time, I decided to merge the modulation tracks with the
note tracks.  It's easier for me, and I don't think it will
hurt most people's playback.

	For the pitch bend, set your guitar patches to respond
to the range of -8169 to +8064 with pitch bend of -1 to +1
octaves.  The PSS-790, even with only 7 significant digits to
the pitch bend, having to cover a whole octave, still provides
adequately smooth bending.

	I finally did away with my HT-700; my little daughter
has control of it now, though I might find it useful on
rare occasions.  I still use the MT-240, but now I can do
all composing on a single machine.  A great relief.
