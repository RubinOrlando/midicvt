Test Results for midicvt and midicvtpp
2015-08-19 to 2015-08-21

The tests results in this directory come from the midicomp and midi2text
projects.  The latter's text-file results were renamed with the "asc"
extension.

In many cases, we don't have a recompiled version of a MIDI file.  So we
have to make our own.  To be sure that the MIDI files are the same, we
then convert each to ASCII.  If the ASCII files match, we're pretty sure the
conversion from ASCII to MIDI went correctly.

In other case, we have to convert to MIDI, and then reconvert to ASCII to
see that the results are the same.  In many cases, the --m2m option and the
--compile options restore event bytes that were not in the original (flawed)
MIDI files.

Oddities:

   In ex1.mid, the time signature event specific is FF 58 02, not
   FF 58 04.  That is, it is two bytes shorter than the MIDI specification.
   However, the note that follows is reached correctly.  Perhaps it is a
   special case?  Something to investigate.  When played by the timidity
   application, it outputs a message "Invalid time signature".
