The tests results in this directory come from the midicomp and midi2text
projects.  The latter's text-file results were renamed with the "asc"
extension.

In many cases, we don't have a recompiled version of a MIDI file.  So we
have to make our own.  To be sure that the MIDI files are the same, we
then convert each to ASCII.  If the ASCII files match, we're pretty sure the
conversion from ASCII to MIDI went correctly.

In other case, we have to convert to MIDI, and then reconvert to ASCII to
see that the results are the same.  In many cases, the --m2m option and the
--compile options restore event bytes that were not in the original (flawed)
MIDI files.
