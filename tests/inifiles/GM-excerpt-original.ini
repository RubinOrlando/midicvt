# This file provides a very small set of transformations for testing only.

# We cannot test --reverse with the full PSS-790 because the mapping is
# not one-to-one in both directions.
#
# This file is meant to be used only with the ex1.mid MIDI file.
#
# We still need a MIDI file suitable for testing reverse patching.
