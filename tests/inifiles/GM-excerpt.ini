# This file provides a very small set of transformations for testing only.

# We cannot test --reverse with the full PSS-790 because the mapping is
# not one-to-one in both directions.

# This file is meant to be used only with the ex1.mid MIDI file.

# We still need a MIDI file suitable for testing reverse patching.
#
# Currently, the map-type is wrong.  This is currently only a drum file.
