This project supports MIDI-to-text-to-MIDI conversions like midicomp and
midi2text (it is derived from those projects), and adds support for direct
MIDI-to-MIDI conversions driven by an INI file, using a C++ add-on.

The C++ project can also transform the patch numbers of files, converting the
to General MIDI (GM) format, for example.

Currently Linux-only, and built by GNU Autotools.

TODO:

   1. Fill in a few areas of documentation.
   2. Add support for creating a Debian package.
   3. Add still more tests and examples.
