Try to get rid of the memory leaks from:

   $ valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all  \
         midicvt/midicvt -c ex1.asc -o e.mid

   Done!  Had to expose yylex_destroy() and make sure it got called.

Then search for more memory leaks.

Also:

   $ ./midicvt -c ex1.asc
   <binary MIDI bytes>
   ? Error at offset -1 (0xffffffffffffffff)
   Error: error seeking during final stage of write

   Done!  Had to avoid fseek(fp, -1, 0).

The test script passed, so hopefully we have not introduced any bugs.

So, another to-do is to add more tests!

# vim: ts=3 sw=3 et ft=sh
