Try to get rid of the memory leaks from:

   $ valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all  \
         midicvt/midicvt -c ex1.asc -o e.mid

   Done!  Had to expose yylex_destroy() and make sure it got called.

Then search for more memory leaks.

Also:

   $ ./midicvt -c ex1.asc
   <binary MIDI bytes>
   ? Error at offset -1 (0xffffffffffffffff)
   Error: error seeking during final stage of write

   Done!  Had to avoid fseek(fp, -1, 0).

More Test Issues Found by Valgrind:

   Warning: invalid file descriptor -1 in syscall dup2()

      ../midicvt/midicvt --mfile -i midifiles/ex1.mid -o tmp/ex1.asc
      ../midicvt/midicvt --mfile --m2m --input midifiles/ex1.mid \
            --output tmp/ex1-m2m.mid
      ../midicvt/midicvt --mfile -t -i midifiles/choo2xg.mid -o tmp/choo2xg.asc
      ../midicvt/midicvt --mfile --m2m --input midifiles/choo2xg.mid \
            --output tmp/choo2xg-m2m.mid

   ... And a lot more of that issue.

   Done!  It appears that the call to dup2() in revert_stdout() in the
   midicvt_base.c module is not necessary, and it errors out every time
   anyway.  We just commented that call out.

   ../midicvtpp/midicvtpp --mfile -i results/stomtors/stomtors-drum
   s-16.mid -o tmp/stomtors-drums-16.asc

      HEAP SUMMARY:  in use at exit: 72,704 bytes in 1 blocks
                     total heap usage: 6 allocs, 5 frees, 76,302 bytes allocated

   The heap issue seems to be an internal thing occurring in dl-init.c, not
   sure we can do anything about it.

The test script passed, so hopefully we have not introduced any bugs.

So, another to-do is to add more tests!
